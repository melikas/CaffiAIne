      "agent_response": "\nProcess user request: its fridays night, where should I go?:\n## Analysis of the Task\n\nThe user is asking for a recommendation on where to go on a Friday night. This is an open-ended question requiring more information to provide a truly helpful answer. The provided context lacks crucial information about the user's preferences (e.g., desired activity type, budget, location, company).  We can infer that it's Friday night, implying a desire for leisure or entertainment.\n\n## Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Acknowledge the request and the need for more information:**  Start by confirming that we understand the user wants Friday night plans and explain that more details are needed for a tailored recommendation.\n\n2. **Ask clarifying questions:**  Prompt the user for preferences regarding the following:\n    * **Type of activity:**  (e.g.,  \"Are you looking for a lively bar, a quiet restaurant, a concert, a movie, or something else entirely?\")\n    * **Desired atmosphere:** (e.g., \"Do you prefer something casual or more upscale?\")\n    * **Budget:** (e.g., \"Are you looking for something budget-friendly, mid-range, or splurge-worthy?\")\n    * **Location:** (e.g., \"What city or neighborhood are you interested in?\")\n    * **Company:** (e.g., \"Are you going out alone, with friends, or on a date?\")\n\n3. **Provide general suggestions (if no further info is given):** If the user doesn't provide more specifics, offer a few generic but diverse options, making it clear these are just starting points.  Examples could include:\n    * **Catching a movie:**  A classic Friday night activity.\n    * **Exploring a new restaurant or bar:** Suggest checking online reviews or local guides.\n    * **Going to a concert or live music venue:** If the user's city has a vibrant music scene.\n    * **Visiting a museum or art gallery:** For a more cultural experience.\n    * **Having a relaxed night in with friends:** Suggesting board games, movies, or cooking together.\n\n4. **Process user responses (if provided):** Once the user gives additional preferences, use this information to filter and refine recommendations. For example, if the user specifies they want a budget-friendly, casual restaurant in a specific neighborhood, we can use external resources (like Yelp, Google Maps, or event listings) to generate more specific and relevant suggestions.\n\n5. **Present recommendations clearly:**  Once we have enough information, present the recommendations in a concise and easy-to-understand format.  This could be a bulleted list or a numbered list, including names, addresses (if applicable), and a brief description of each suggestion.\n\n\n## Final Result/Recommendation (Initial Response - before further information from user)\n\n\"It's Friday night, and I'd love to help you find the perfect place to go! To give you the best recommendations, I need a little more information.  \n\nCould you tell me:\n\n* What kind of activity are you interested in tonight? (e.g., dinner, drinks, dancing, a show, etc.)\n* What sort of atmosphere are you looking for? (e.g., casual, upscale, lively, quiet)\n* What's your budget like?\n* Where are you located?\n* Who are you going with (if anyone)?\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few general ideas to get you started:\n\n* Catch a movie at your local cinema.\n* Explore a new restaurant or bar in your area.\n* See if any interesting concerts or live music events are happening.\n* Check out any museums or art galleries that might be open late.\n* Have a relaxing night in with friends, playing games or watching movies.\n\n\nOnce you tell me a bit more about what you're looking for, I can give you more specific recommendations!\"\n\n",

While the specific 2025 program won't be released until much closer to the date, here's some general information:\n\n* **Focus:**  Comedy (stand-up, improv, galas, street performances)\n* **Typical Dates:** Late June to early August (check the official website closer to the date)\n* **Venues:** Numerous venues across the city, often including:\n    * Place des Arts: 175 Ste-Catherine St W, Montreal, QC H2X 3X5\n    * Théâtre Saint-Denis: 1594 Saint-Denis St, Montreal, QC H2X 3K4\n    * Club Soda: 1225 St-Laurent Blvd, Montreal, QC H2X 2S6\n    * Various smaller clubs and outdoor stages.\n* **Transportation from Downtown:**\n    * Place des Arts: Directly connected to Place-des-Arts metro station (Green line).\n    * Théâtre Saint-Denis: Short walk from Berri-UQAM (Green, Orange, Yellow lines) or Saint-Laurent (Green line) metro stations.\n    * Club Soda: Short walk from Saint-Laurent (Green line) metro station.\n    * Other venues: Use the STM website (stm.info) or app for specific routes.\n* **Estimated Cost (based on previous years - expect potential increases):**\n    * Individual show tickets: $30-$150+ CAD (depending on the performer and venue).\n    * Festival passes: Typically available but vary widely in price depending on the level of access.\n* **Practical Details:**\n    * Book tickets well in advance for popular shows, as they often sell out quickly.\n    * Free outdoor shows are a great option but can get crowded.\n    * Check the official Just For Laughs website closer to the date for the most up-to-date schedule and ticket information.\n\n**Other Possibilities (check official websites closer to the date):**\n\n* **Festival International de Films de Montréal (FIM) (Late August/Early September):** World cinema screenings.\n* **Osheaga Music and Arts Festival (Typically late July/early August - unlikely to still be running on July 25th, but check just in case):** Large outdoor music festival (often the weekend before or after Just For Laughs).\n\n**Cost Estimation (Just For Laughs Example):**\n\nIt's impossible to provide an exact cost estimate without knowing the specific shows you'd attend, but here's a potential breakdown for a single day at Just For Laughs (assuming you're already in Montreal and have accommodation sorted):\n\n* **1 Ticketed Show (Mid-range):** $75 CAD\n* **Lunch:** $20 CAD\n* **Dinner:** $30 CAD\n* **Drinks:** $20 CAD\n* **Transportation (Metro):** $10 CAD (assuming a few rides)\n* **Souvenir (optional):** $15 CAD\n* **Total:** $170 CAD (This is a rough estimate. Your actual cost will depend on your choices.)\n\n\n**Action Plan for July 25, 2025:**\n\n1. **Late 2024/Early 2025:** Start checking the official websites of festivals like Just For Laughs and others that interest you. They will begin releasing preliminary information around this time.\n2. **Spring 2025:** Look out for lineup announcements and ticket sale dates. Sign up for festival newsletters for updates.\n3. **Summer 2025:** Finalize your plans, buy tickets, book any remaining necessities, and double-check all details.\n\nBy staying informed and planning ahead, you'll be ready to enjoy the Montreal festival scene in July 2025! \n",

        "response": "## Analysis of the Task\n\nThe user is asking for a recommendation on where to go on a Friday night. This is an open-ended question requiring more information to provide a truly helpful answer. The provided context lacks crucial information about the user's preferences (e.g., desired activity type, budget, location, company).  We can infer that it's Friday night, implying a desire for leisure or entertainment.\n\n## Step-by-Step Approach\n\n1. **Acknowledge the request and the need for more information:**  Start by confirming that we understand the user wants Friday night plans and explain that more details are needed for a tailored recommendation.\n\n2. **Ask clarifying questions:**  Prompt the user for preferences regarding the following:\n    * **Type of activity:**  (e.g.,  \"Are you looking for a lively bar, a quiet restaurant, a concert, a movie, or something else entirely?\")\n    * **Desired atmosphere:** (e.g., \"Do you prefer something casual or more upscale?\")\n    * **Budget:** (e.g., \"Are you looking for something budget-friendly, mid-range, or splurge-worthy?\")\n    * **Location:** (e.g., \"What city or neighborhood are you interested in?\")\n    * **Company:** (e.g., \"Are you going out alone, with friends, or on a date?\")\n\n3. **Provide general suggestions (if no further info is given):** If the user doesn't provide more specifics, offer a few generic but diverse options, making it clear these are just starting points.  Examples could include:\n    * **Catching a movie:**  A classic Friday night activity.\n    * **Exploring a new restaurant or bar:** Suggest checking online reviews or local guides.\n    * **Going to a concert or live music venue:** If the user's city has a vibrant music scene.\n    * **Visiting a museum or art gallery:** For a more cultural experience.\n    * **Having a relaxed night in with friends:** Suggesting board games, movies, or cooking together.\n\n4. **Process user responses (if provided):** Once the user gives additional preferences, use this information to filter and refine recommendations. For example, if the user specifies they want a budget-friendly, casual restaurant in a specific neighborhood, we can use external resources (like Yelp, Google Maps, or event listings) to generate more specific and relevant suggestions.\n\n5. **Present recommendations clearly:**  Once we have enough information, present the recommendations in a concise and easy-to-understand format.  This could be a bulleted list or a numbered list, including names, addresses (if applicable), and a brief description of each suggestion.\n\n\n## Final Result/Recommendation (Initial Response - before further information from user)\n\n\"It's Friday night, and I'd love to help you find the perfect place to go! To give you the best recommendations, I need a little more information.  \n\nCould you tell me:\n\n* What kind of activity are you interested in tonight? (e.g., dinner, drinks, dancing, a show, etc.)\n* What sort of atmosphere are you looking for? (e.g., casual, upscale, lively, quiet)\n* What's your budget like?\n* Where are you located?\n* Who are you going with (if anyone)?\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few general ideas to get you started:\n\n* Catch a movie at your local cinema.\n* Explore a new restaurant or bar in your area.\n* See if any interesting concerts or live music events are happening.\n* Check out any museums or art galleries that might be open late.\n* Have a relaxing night in with friends, playing games or watching movies.\n\n\nOnce you tell me a bit more about what you're looking for, I can give you more specific recommendations!\"\n",
