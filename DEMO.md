## üìã Demo Script Suggestions

### Opening (30 seconds)
```
"Welcome to CaffiAIne, an intelligent agentic AI system that uses Google's Gemini API 
to process user requests through a sophisticated workflow of planning, execution, and 
memory management. Let me show you how it works."
```

### Setup Demonstration (30 seconds)
```
"First, let's set up the system. I've already configured my Google Gemini API key 
in the environment file. Now I'll run the application and show you the initial system status."
```

### Planning Demonstration (60 seconds)
```
"Now let's see how the system plans tasks. I'll ask it to search for information 
about AI and analyze trends. Watch how it breaks this down into specific, actionable tasks 
using the Gemini API for intelligent planning."
```

### Execution Demonstration (60 seconds)
```
"Here you can see the system executing each planned task, calling the Gemini API 
with appropriate context, and storing results in memory. Notice how it handles 
multiple tasks and maintains conversation history."
```

### Memory & Learning (60 seconds)
```
"The system learns from each interaction. You can see how it stores conversations, 
identifies patterns, and uses this knowledge to improve future responses. 
The memory is persistent and grows more intelligent over time."
```

### Edge Cases (30 seconds)
```
"Let me show you how the system handles errors gracefully. Even when things go wrong, 
it provides helpful feedback and continues operating."
```
